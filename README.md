# FOV-Changer-DLL-Beta
 May rebrand, only for backup

 Is **not updated** and consequently does not work with the newest mc version!

## Disclaimer
This project is currently dead and inactive. Perhaps I will work on it again in the future.
Also, the code **is pretty messy** mainly because most of it is only **for testing purposes**.
